Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a sustainable alternative, powered by electricity for reduced emissions and lower running costs. They are becoming increasingly popular for their eco-friendly and efficient performance. 
With the increasing need to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels, electric vehicles
(EVs) have emerged as a promising alternative in India’s transportation sector. Over the past few years,
India has witnessed significant growth in the adoption of electric vehicles, driven by government
initiatives, state-level subsidies, and rising environmental awareness among consumers.
India’s electric vehicle (EV) market is rapidly growing as states promote sustainable transportation. This
project analyzes state-wise EV sales data to understand regional adoption patterns and forecast future
demand.
EV adoption rates vary significantly across states due to policy, infrastructure, and consumer awareness.
Identifying these trends and predicting future sales is crucial for manufacturers, policymakers, and
investors to make data-driven decisions for production, marketing, and charging infrastructure planning.
